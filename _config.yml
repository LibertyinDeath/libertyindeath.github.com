  For the brave souls who get this far: 
  You are the chosen ones,the valiant knights of programming who toil away, without rest, fixing our most awful code. 
  To you, true saviors, kings of men,I say this: never gonna give you up, never gonna let you down,never gonna run around and desert you. 
  Never gonna make you cry,never gonna say goodbye. Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you.
baseurl: "" # the subpath of your site, e.g. /blog
url: "http://yourdomain.com" # the base hostname & protocol for your site
